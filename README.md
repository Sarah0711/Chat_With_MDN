# Chat_With_MDN


This is an app for a chat where everyone can chat about Web Development.  It has StropheJS-a type of JavaScript programming language.  It also has RequireJS for modules for my code for my chat widget.  Feel free to add code to it to make it even better.  But, please, if you alter the package.json file of it to add yourself as devs of it, please do not remove me as the main one of it.

Thank you.
